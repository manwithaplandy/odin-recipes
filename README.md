Recipes website from The Odin Project's Fundamentals course

This is used to demonstrate understanding and practice of basic HTML code. Skills learned so far include the use of creating boilerplate HTML code, specifying language and encoding, formatting the page, adding links and images, creating lists, and organizing the file structure.

This project solidified my understanding of all of these fundamental HTML topics, and I can say from experience these recipes are delicious.

Additionally, I have used some basic CSS elements to style my page in very basic ways.
